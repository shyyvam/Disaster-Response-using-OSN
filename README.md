# Disaster-Response-using-OSN
First a Dataset of messages is used which is disaste.csv file it has many messages for disaster.
Later its all the entities are extracted which are all the keywords.
Later suppose their coordinates are known(which I coundn't know so I took all the coordinates randomly and added to the file)
And later used K meanclustering to find the hotspots or main location which will be our target for response.
Change the locations accordingly.
